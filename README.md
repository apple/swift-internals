# Swift Internals

This is the source for the
[Swift Internals](http://apple.github.io/swift-internals) website,
which hosts internal documentation for:
- The Swift compiler and standard library.
- The [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines.html),
automatically regenerated from [this source](https://github.com/apple/swift-internals/tree/gh-pages/api-design-guidelines).

## Local Testing and Development

1. Have Ruby >= 2.0.0 installed.
2. `gem install bundler` - this command must normally be run with
   sudo/root/admin privileges.
3. `bundle install` - run this command as a regular, unprivileged user.
4. `LC_ALL=en_us.UTF-8 bundle exec jekyll serve --baseurl /swift-internals`
5. Visit [http://localhost:4000/swift-internals/](http://localhost:4000/swift-internals).
6. Make edits to the source, refresh your browser, lather, rinse, repeat.

Notes: 

* Changes to `_config.yml` require restarting the local server (step 4
  above).
* If you make changes to `_config.yml` specifically in order to serve
  these pages from an address other than
  http://apple.github.io/swift-internals, please make sure those
  changes are not included in any pull requests, so we don't
  inadvertently break the main site.
