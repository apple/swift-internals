In Swift, a protocol that does not have `Self` or associated type requirements can be used as a type. You can use a variable or constant of a protocol type, also called an __existential type__, to hold a value of any conforming type:
```swift 
protocol Animal {
    func makeNoise()
    static var species: String { get }
}
struct Dog: Animal {
    func makeNoise() { print("Woof") }
    static var species: String = "Canus familiaris"
}
struct Cat: Animal {
    func makeNoise() { print("Meow") }
    static var species: String = "Felis catus"
}
var animal: Animal // `Animal` is used here as a type.
animal = Dog()
animal.makeNoise() // Prints "Woof".
animal = Cat()
animal.makeNoise() // Prints "Meow".
```
Notice that it is possible to invoke the method `makeNoise()` on a value of type `Animal`, just as it is possible to do so on a value of concrete type `Dog` or `Cat`. However, the static property `species` is not available for the existential type:
```swift
print(Dog.species)    // Prints "Canus familiaris"
print(Cat.species)    // Prints "Felis catus"
print(Animal.species) // error: static member 'species' cannot be used...
```
Since a type conforms to a protocol only when it satisfies _all_ of that protocol's requirements, the existential type `Animal` does not conform to the protocol `Animal` because it cannot satisfy the protocol's requirement for the static property `species`:
```swift
func declareAnimalSpecies<T: Animal>(_ animal: T) {
    animal.makeNoise()
    print("My species is known as \(T.species)")
}
let dog = Dog()
declareAnimalSpecies(dog)
// Prints:
// "Woof"
// "My species is known as Canus familiaris"
declareAnimalSpecies(animal)
// error: protocol type 'Animal' cannot conform to 'Animal'...
```
In general, any initializers, static members, and associated types required by a protocol can be used only via conforming concrete types. Although Swift allows a protocol that requires initializers or static members to be used as a type, that type _does not and cannot_ conform to the protocol itself.
Currently, even if a protocol `P` requires no initializers or static members, the existential type `P` does not conform to `P` (with exceptions below). This restriction allows library authors to add such requirements (initializers or static members) to an existing protocol without breaking their users' source code.
Concrete types that _do_ conform to protocols can provide functionality similar to that of existential types. For example, the standard library provides the `AnyHashable` type for `Hashable` values. Manual implementation of such __type erasure__ can require specific knowledge of the semantic requirements for each protocol involved and is beyond the scope of this discussion.
For more on using existential types, see [Protocols as Types](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/Protocols.html#ID275) in _The Swift Programming Language_.
## Exceptions
The Swift protocol `Error` has no required members and, when used as a type, conforms to itself; `@objc` protocols with no static requirements can also be used as types that conform to themselves.
